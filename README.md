# Jas' Openbox dotfiles

These are my dotfiles that I use on my workhorse, unfortunately I'm not skilled enough with scripting to create a script that can install it for you so for now just copy into your .config folder.

## Usage

Simply drag and drop my dotfiles into your ```.config/``` folder in your home, or copy these set of commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/jsrii/dots.git
mv ~/dots ~/.config
```

Then reload your apps or just restart your device and the configs should be applied.
